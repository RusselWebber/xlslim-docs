xlSlim is available to download and use free of charge. The core functionality of xlSlim will always be free. However premium features require a premium licence. Premium licences can be purchased at `xlslim.com`_. 

14 day trial licences are created automatically when xlSlim is first run on your PC. Thus you will have the opportunity to evaluate premium features.
