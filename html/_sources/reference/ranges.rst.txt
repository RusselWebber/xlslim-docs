Special Named Ranges
====================

xlSlim uses a named range `XLSLIM_RUN_AT_START` to define which cells should be run when a workbook is opened.

Each cell in the named range is recalculated in the order the cells appear in the named range.

.. note::
	Interactive cells are not supported and cannot be automatically run.
