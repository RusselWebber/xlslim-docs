Special Named Ranges
====================

xlSlim uses a named range `XLSLIM_RUN_AT_START` to define which cells should be run when a workbook is opened.

Each cell in the named range is recalculated in the order the cells appear in the named range.

Both regular and interactive cells are supported. Note that to recalculate interactive cells the :func:`ActivateInteractiveMode` function call will need to be in the `XLSLIM_RUN_AT_START` named range and appear before any interactive cells.
