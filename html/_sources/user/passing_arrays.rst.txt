Passing lists
=============

xlSlim supports passing lists to and from Excel. The data is read from Excel ranges.

.. note::
	xlSlim has a useful utility function :func:`CreateRange` that can be used to create range inputs from non-adjacent cells.

This Python module contains functions to calculate basic statistics on lists of numbers. As usual the code has *no changes* to support xlSlim.

.. code-block:: python

	import statistics
	from typing import List


	def basic_stats(data: List[float]) -> List[float]:
		"""Returns a list of [mean, median, mode] of the supplied list."""
		return [mean(data), median(data), mode(data)]


	def mean(data: List[float]) -> float:
		"""Calculate the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the list."""
		return statistics.mean(data)


	def median(data: List[float]) -> float:
		"""Calculate the median of the numbers in the list."""
		return statistics.median(data)


	def mode(data: List[float]) -> float:
		"""Calculate the mode of the numbers in the list."""
		return statistics.mode(data)

.. note::
	All the Python code and Excel files shown are available from github in the `xlslim-code-samples`_ repo. I highly recommend downloading the samples from github. The Excel workbooks contain many tips and tricks.

Save the Python code as a new file on your PC. I saved the file in my Documents folder.

Open Excel and enter this :func:`RegisterPyModule` formula (amending the location to match where you saved the file): ::

	=RegisterPyModule("C:\Users\russe\Documents\passing_arrays.py",,"py_")
	
The function is now available to use in Excel. Note how the module functions were registered with the `py_` prefix so they do not clash with the builtin Excel functions with the same names.

Create a range of numbers to use as inputs. Then call `py_mean` passing in the range.

xlSlim supports passing lists back from Python. The `basic_stats` function returns a list from Python with the mean, median and mode of the supplied data. The function output resizes automatically.

Notice how the Excel `TRANSPOSE` function was used to flip the results from one row (default) to one column.

Returning nested lists
----------------------

xlSlim will unroll a returned list of lists so each inner list is a row in Excel. The simple Python function below returns a list of lists.

.. code-block:: python

	def return_matrix():
		return [
			["Col1", "Col2"],
			[True, "row1 col2"],
			["row2 col1", 2.5],
		]

Add the function to passing_arrays.py and reload the module using the :func:`RegisterPyModule` function.

Call the function and you will see the functions results are handled correctly:
