Logs
----

The log files will usually contain details of what has gone wrong.

The function :func:`LogLocation` can be used to find the log location. 

Two log files are present:
 * addinlog.txt - this log contains xlSlim's internal logs, details of module registrations and so on.
 * xlslim-python.log - this is a regular Python log file, if your code logs with the regular Python `logging`_ module then your log messages will be redirected here.

The xlSlim internal log uses the `Nlog`_ project, the usual NLog.config configuration file can be used to amend the logging.

The Python logging can be customised by editing the PyLogging-EXCEL.conf configuration file.

Licensing
---------

For licensing issues, see :doc:`/user/licensing`, in particular note the standalone "xlSlim License Manager" application that can be used to view license details and perform offline activations.

If you are behind a firewall please whitelist api.licensespring.com on port 443.

General
-------

Python environment problems can be investigated with the :func:`PythonDetails` function.

Over time, the Google group `xlslim-support`_ will become a repository of common issues and solutions.
