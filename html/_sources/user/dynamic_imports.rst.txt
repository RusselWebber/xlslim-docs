		xlSlim can register Python functions from text in the workbook.

Dynamic Module Importing
=========================

xlSlim can create Excel functions directly from Python code in the workbook.

If you would like to use this little function in Excel:

.. code-block:: python
	
	def is_palindrome(s): return s[::-1].lower()==s.lower()

Paste the code into an Excel cell:

  :width: 400
  :alt: Paste simple function text into Excel

Register a new Excel function with this :func:`CreatePyModule` formula: ::

	=CreatePyModule(A1)

.. image:: ../_static/dynamic_imports_register_simple_function.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Register simple function from text

And the new `is_palindrome()` function is available to use in Excel:

.. image:: ../_static/dynamic_imports_call_simple_function.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Call the new simple function

It is that easy to create Excel functions from Python code snippets!

Perhaps we would like to use this function in Excel:

.. code-block:: python

	from datetime import datetime

	def seconds_between(d1:datetime,d2:datetime)->float:
		"""Return the number of seconds between d1 and d2. """
		return (d2-d1).total_seconds()

As before, we paste the text into an Excel cell:

.. image:: ../_static/dynamic_imports_paste_longer_function.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Paste longer function text into Excel

.. note::
	Alt-Enter can be used in Excel to create a new line in a cell.

And register a new Excel function with this :func:`CreatePyModule` formula: ::

	=CreatePyModule(A1)

.. image:: ../_static/dynamic_imports_register_longer_function.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Register longer function from text

And the new `seconds_between()` function is available to use in Excel:

.. image:: ../_static/dynamic_imports_call_longer_function.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Call longer function in Excel

Notice how the type hints and doc strings have been processed and used in the Excel function.

.. note::
	All the Python code and Excel files shown are available from github in the `xlslim-code-samples`_ repo. I highly recommend downloading the samples from github. The Excel workbooks contain many tips and tricks.
